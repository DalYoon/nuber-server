# 1.65 GetNearbyDrivers Resolver part Two

## section.log

- very important lecture
- what's the difference between `Active Record`, `Data Mapper` in typeorm
- define `GetNearbyDrivers` resolver with `Data Mapper`

## tips

> In TypeORM you can use both the Active Record and the Data Mapper patterns.

> Using the Active Record approach, you define all your query methods inside the model itself, and you save, remove, and load objects using model methods.

> Using the Data Mapper approach, you define all your query methods in separate classes called "repositories", and you save, remove, and load objects using repositories. In data mapper your entities are very dumb - they just define their properties and may have some "dummy" methods.
