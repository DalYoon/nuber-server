# 1.2 Project Setup. Typescript and NodeJS

## section.log

- write script for cammand `yarn dev`

## tips

- the script below will monitor the change of .ts file and also .graphql file automatically (nodemon, ts-node)
- just make sure there is no space between file types `ts,graphql`, at the example below, <br>
  it looks like there is space after `ts,`, but it just automatically generated by stupid md generator, <br>
  i didn't put any space at there, and you shouldn't do that too

```
package.json
...
"scripts": {
    "dev": "cd src && nodemon --exec ts-node index.ts -e ts,graphql"
}
...
```
